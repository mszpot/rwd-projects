        Her research on radioactivity was a scientific breakthrough,
        earning her two Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry. She
        was not only a brilliant scientist, but also a modest,
        generous and brave person who overcame social conventions
        that were unfavourable to women at the time of her life.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <div class="text"> 
      <p>
        Marie Curie (<span lang="fr">née</span> <span lang="pl">
        Maria Skłodowska</span>) was the first person to win two 
        Nobel Prizes, and the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. 
        Born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867 she was unable to pursue 
        official higher education in her country due to her being 
        a woman. After high school she studied at the Flying
        University, an underground educational organization. 
        In late 1891 she moved to Paris, where she earned 
        two degrees in physical and mathematical sciences.

    <h2>The First Nobel Prize</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        In 1895 she married Pierre Curie, a fellow scientist, 
        and took French citizenship. Researching radiation,
        a phenomena discovered by <span lang="fr">Henri 
        Becquerel</span>, they discovered two new elements 
        - polonium and radium. Maria and Pierre Curie, 
        together with <span lang="fr">Henri Becquerel</span> 
        won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Marie was 
        the first woman to win such an award.

    <h2>The Second Nobel Prize</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        In 1906, after her husband's tragic death, Marie was offered
        a position at the University of Paris, becoming its first
        female professor in history. She studied radioactive
        compounds and developed a process to isolate pure radium,
        which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.
        Marie was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She
        decided not to patent the process of radium isolation to
        facilitate further research for other scientists.

    <h2>World War I</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        During World War I Marie Curie helped save the lives of 
        thousands of wounded soldiers by setting up radiological 
        stations and donating mobile X-ray ambulances called
        the <span lang="fr"><em>petites Curies</em></span> 
        ("little Curies") to the army. She also conducted 
        radiological training for lab assistants and medical 
        students. Marie even used her Nobel Prize money to invest 
        in war loans, not expecting or wanting to ever get it back.

    <h2>Post-war years</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Post war, Maria Curie continued her research on the 
        chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical 
        applications. Radium Institute (now Curie Institute) 
        founded and led by Maria saw the rise of four more 
        Nobelists, including her own daughter, <span lang="fr">
        Irène</span>. In 1925, with Curie's help, a similar
        institute was opened in Warsaw. Maria Curie died in 1934 
        from aplastic anemia believed to be caused by exposure 
        to radiation.
